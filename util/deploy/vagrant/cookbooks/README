ThreadFix VM README

The following is for Windows users using the generate_vm.bat file.

Things you need to install:
Ruby - http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
Vagrant - http://vagrantup.com/
VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/

If you want to run tests:
Java - http://java.com/en/download/manual_v6.jsp
Maven - http://maven.apache.org/download.html
possibly Git - http://git-scm.com/

And you also need to follow these configuration steps:
Download a copy of the ThreadFix codebase
generate_vm.bat - change line 34 to the path to your ThreadFix codebase
generate_vm.bat - change line 35 to the path the your Java directory
maven_test.bat - change line 1 to the path to your maven directory

What you should have at the end:
A timestamped .box file. It's secretly a .tgz containing normal virtual machine files that you can open with VMware software or VirtualBox.
