ThreadFix
=========

ThreadFix is a software vulnerability aggregation and management system that
reduces the time it takes to fix software vulnerabilities. ThreadFix imports
the results from dynamic, static and manual testing to provide a centralized
view of software security defects across development teams and applications.
The system allows companies to correlate testing results and streamline
software remediation efforts by simplifying feeds to software issue trackers.
By auto generating application firewall rules, this tool allows organizations
to continue remediation work uninterrupted. ThreadFix empowers managers with
vulnerability trending reports that show progress over time, giving them
justification for their efforts.
